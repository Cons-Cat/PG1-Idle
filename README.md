# PG1-Idle

This is a console-based idle game about digging. You get points for digging. You hire agents to aid your enterprise, and agent upgrades to improve efficiency. And you just keep making profit!

This project was developed for our Programming 1 "Programmer's Choice" assignment.

This project had me awarded a "Course Director's Choice" merit upon my graduation.
